    "####  **draw_lines() logic**\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by classifying the input hough lines to 3 groups: left lane lines, right lane lines, and lines to be ignored. \n",
    "\n",
    "This classification is done based on the slope of the input lines dx/dy.\n",
    "* All horizontal lines (slope is between [-0.2, 0.2]) are filtered out.\n",
    "* All lines with slope < -0.2 are classified as left lane.\n",
    "* All lines with slope > 0.2 are classified as right lane.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, a polynomial fit is performed for each of the left and right lane separately, which calculates coefficients for the fitted line. The function of the coefficients is generated for the full range of the X-axis inside the defined region of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last step in draw_lines() is to draw the lines on the raw image. Those lines image are then combined with the original image to generate the final output image.\n",

    "### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some potential shortcomings would be:**\n",
    " * when we drive on a curve, where the region of interest overlays multiple lanes at the top of the defined area.\n",
    " * when there are multiple road marking on the same line, or unclear lines, which do not sustain the fitted line for a longer period of time.\n",
    " * when other cars cut in or cut out the lane in front of the ego vehicle.\n",
    " * when the region of interest contains objects other than empty lanes (e.g. trees, pedestrians, bicycles...etc).\n",
    " * disappearing left or right lane line in case of distorted input hough tranform lines\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "A possible improvement would be to implement a buffer to store the identified lane lines from the polynomial fit, and apply moving average on it. To make sure that the rate of change in the lane is minimal, and to increase the stability of the detected lanes\n",
    "\n",
    "Another potential improvement could be to have the region of interest dynamically configured based on the quality of the input lines coming to the pipeline. In case of clear straight-line roads, the region of interest is quite large. On the other hand, when the road is full of curves, and cutting objects, the region of interest should be minimized to the maximum visible area of the lane.\n",
